# Shape Calculator

## Overview
This project is a shape calculator that calculates the area and perimeter of various shapes including circles, rectangles, and triangles.

## Files
1. `Assignment5_part1.java`: Contains the main class to execute the shape calculator.
2. `Circle.java`: Represents a circle shape and implements the `shape` interface.
3. `Rectangle.java`: Represents a rectangle shape and implements the `shape` interface.
4. `Triangle.java`: Represents a triangle shape and implements the `shape` interface.
5. `Shape.java`: Interface defining methods for calculating the area and perimeter of shapes.

## Usage
To use this shape calculator:
1. Compile all Java files.
2. Execute the `Assignment5_part1` class.
3. Follow the prompts to choose a shape and input the required dimensions.
4. The program will calculate and display the area and perimeter of the chosen shape.

## Classes and Methods

### `Assignment5_part1` Class
- Main class to execute the shape calculator.
- Prompts the user to input a shape and invokes the corresponding shape class.
- Displays the calculated area and perimeter of the chosen shape.

### `Circle` Class
- Represents a circle shape.
- Implements the `shape` interface for calculating the area and perimeter.
- Prompts the user to input the radius of the circle.

### `Rectangle` Class
- Represents a rectangle shape.
- Implements the `shape` interface for calculating the area and perimeter.
- Prompts the user to input the length and width of the rectangle.

### `Triangle` Class
- Represents a triangle shape.
- Implements the `shape` interface for calculating the area and perimeter.
- Prompts the user to input the base, height, and lengths of two sides of the triangle.

### `Shape` Interface
- Defines methods for calculating the area and perimeter of shapes.
